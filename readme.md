# AoC

AdventofCode challenges solved in scala.

## Structure

Top-level starts with a folder for every year.

Second-level is for every day from first to 25th december.

First of all, I solve it until the end by worksheets.

While the holidays, I'll rewrite every challenge to a best practice Project.

## 2022

`scalaVersion := "3.2.1"`
